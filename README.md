# TODO APP
This is the code provided as an example for you to edit on your own and alter to adapt your apps needs.  It is a React.js application that uses the Chakra UI library for the frontend.  The backend is provided as an example of how to integrate your database to an application and has examples of all four CRUD operations.  As my database is local, this app will not run properly on your device but the axios database calls demonstrate how to adapt it to your own database.  However, the front end should still render, even if the buttons do not work.  In short, this code will:
- Demonstrate a sample backend using node.js
- Demonstrate how to use backend endpoints in the frontend code
- Demonstrate routing in a react.js application
- Demonstrate the use of Chakra UI so you can use the documentation to implement your own UI elements
- Demonstrate the use of React.js components (Navbar and ListItem)

## How to use this repo

Start by cloning this repository into an appropriate folder on your device and navigating to that folder.

# Backend

These instructions will set up the backend example for your project.  Once the server is up and running, you should be able to connect to the backend on http://localhost:8080 (or another port if you choose to change it) and test your project's endpoints once you code them.

1. Navigate into the backend folder: ```cd backend```
2. 


# Frontend
2. Run ```cd frontend``` to navigate to the frontend foler
3. Run ```npm install``` to install the correct dependencies for the react app
4. Run ```npm start``` to start up the frontend and to run the app on http://localhost:3000
